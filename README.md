# Concept

The purpose of this repository is making a scalable and reusable content management system.

## Hidden purpose

The *actual* general purpose of this repository is joining a study group to enhance my production management skills and wiring my existing stacks with new libraries and runtime.
Also, I am currently jumping to backend world again just like the beginning of my development life.
