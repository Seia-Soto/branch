# Concept

The purpose of this repository is making a scalable and reusable content management system.

## Hidden purpose

The *actual* general purpose of this repository is joining a study group to enhance my production management skills and wiring my existing stacks with new libraries and runtime.
Also, I am currently jumping to backend world again just like the beginning of my development life.

## About TypeScript

Actually, I have a lot of words to say about my TypeScript project.
Yes, I know that you all use TypeScript at all however I don't prefer to work with TypeScript and external libraries and runtime that requires compile-time instead of running directly.
Basically, I think that simple is better than consuming time by configuring a lot of thing, and already JavaScript works well modernly in and it is following partly where TypeScript goes.
However, actually many people think I don't know TypeScript and hate it, but I know how to work with TypeScript and used it a lot of times in real work.
The reason why I am starting this project with TypeScript in this time is because I want to join to specific study group.
I don't know how to become a someone who study group want to welcome, so I think I need to make me valuable.
Also, at this time, not like past few years, We can code with TypeScript without big deal.
TypeScript is popular than before so that almost libraries are already typed.
